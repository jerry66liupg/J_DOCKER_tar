# Self-hosting Firecrawl

Refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on how to run it locally.

*This repository is currently in its early stages of development. We are in the process of merging custom modules into this mono repository. The primary objective is to enhance the accuracy of LLM responses by utilizing clean data. It is not ready for full self-host yet - we're working on it*
